Lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymphatic system (lymph nodes) and can be classified as either Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Because the lymphatic system runs throughout a person’s body, lymphoma can occur in several areas within the body.

Traditionally, lymphoma is treated with chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy. But because many lymphomas occur in the chest near critical structures such as the heart, lungs or esophagus, it can be difficult to get the high doses of radiation needed to the tumor without causing damage to those sensitive areas. With proton therapy, our specialized team of cancer experts are able to create a treatment plan that precisely targets even the most difficult to reach lymphoma tumors while minimizing the damage to healthy tissues and vital organs.

Proton therapy is especially valuable in treating patients with lymphoma whose tumors are in the chest or involve the anterior mediastinum, as well as those whose tumors that have proven to be resistant to chemotherapy. For patients with chemotherapy-resistant tumors that require targeted high doses of radiation, proton therapy may be the only hope for curative treatment.

With proton therapy for lymphoma, treatments typically take about 15 to 30 minutes each day and are delivered five days a week for approximately four to seven weeks. The course of treatment and length of time per treatment each day varies based on each patient’s individual case. Most patients tolerate the treatments extremely well and are able to continue to work and exercise during their treatment course and immediately after treatment is complete.

Patients with lymphoma who receive proton therapy will generally undergo chemotherapy first, followed by proton therapy treatment.
