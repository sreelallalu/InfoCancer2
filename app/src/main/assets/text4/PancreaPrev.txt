Although there's no proven way to prevent pancreatic cancer, you can take steps to reduce your risk, including:

Stop smoking. 
If you smoke, stop. Talk to your doctor about strategies to help you stop, including support groups, medications and nicotine replacement therapy. If you don't smoke, don't start.

Maintain a healthy weight.
If you currently have a healthy weight, work to maintain it. If you need to lose weight, aim for a slow, steady weight loss â€” 1 or 2 pounds (0.5 or 1 kilogram) a week. Combine daily exercise with a diet rich in vegetables, fruit and whole grains with smaller portions to help you lose weight.

Choose a healthy diet. 
A diet full of colorful fruits and vegetables and whole grains may help reduce your risk of cancer.
