A 2008 study commissioned by the World Health Organisation concluded that "specific fruit and vegetables may act to reduce the risk of bladder cancer."Fruit and yellow-orange vegetables, particularly carrots and those containing selenium,are probably associated with a moderately reduced risk of bladder cancer. Citrus fruits and cruciferous vegetables were also identified as having a possibly protective effect. However an analysis of 47,909 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study showed little correlation between cancer reduction and high consumption of fruits and vegetables overall, or yellow or green leafy vegetables specifically, compared to the statistically significant reduction among those men who consumed large amounts of cruciferous vegetables.
Several studies have suggested the bladder is one of the most responsive organs to induction of detoxification enzymes by extract. This was evident in human bladder cancer cells in vitro and in animal models in vivo. Sulforaphane and broccoli sprout extract were also observed to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human bladder cancer cells in vitro, an anti-cancer effect attributed to the sulforaphane potential in the sprouts.

In addition I recommend to read section risk factors.

Risk Factors:
Smoking is the most well-established risk factor for bladder cancer. Smokers’ risk of bladder cancer is approximately four-fold that of nonsmokers’, and smoking is estimated to cause about half of all bladder cancer cases in both men and women. Workers in the dye, rubber, or leather industries, painters, and people who live in communities with high levels of arsenic in the drinking water also have increased risk.
